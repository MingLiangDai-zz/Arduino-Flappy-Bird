# Arduino-Flappy-Bird
**Description:**
This is an Arduino project that simulates the popular game, Flappy bird, using the potentiometer and the 8 by 8 LED display board. The potentiometer is used as a controller to move the “bird” and the “pipes” are generated according to an algorithm. The goal of this game is to last as long as possible without hitting the obstacles in the path of “bird”. The difficulty of this game gets higher as time passes because the obstacles will reach the bird faster and faster.
